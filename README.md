# Description of the project 
TeaTemp is a sensor to monitor the temperature of your hot drink. Imagine that you boil water to prepare tea, at the beggining the tea is too hot for you to drink it, but if you wait too long finally it can get too cold. TeaTemp allows you to constantly monitor the temperature of the tea and drink your tea only when the temperature is suitable for you!

# State of the art 
TeaTemp, in it's first prototype version, allows you connect via BLE bluetooth with your smartphone and see the temperature on your phone. First you need to plug in the sensor using USB-C cable, then you can insert the waterproof sensor to your drink. To connect with the sensor you can use for example nRF Connect app, which is available both for android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=pl&pli=1) and IOS (https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403?l=pl)
